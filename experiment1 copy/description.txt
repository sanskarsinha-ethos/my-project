My learnings:
This HTML taught how to structure
a basic web form using the <form> tag.
Than i implemented different input fields
like text, email, and number, and associate
them with <label> elements for better 
accessibility. It also demonstrates
implementing built-in browser validation 
using attributes like required, minlength,
and max.
